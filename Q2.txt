Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in javascript based on their functionality.
    provide examples for each category.

Answer - 

Categorization of Operators - 

* Arithmetic Operators: These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation 
                        (**). They operate on numerical values to perform basic mathematical calculations.

                        ex - let x = 10
                             let y = 20
                             let z = x + y;

* Increment and Decrement Operators: These operators (++, --) are used to increase or decrease the value of variables by one, either 
                                     before or after their use in expressions.

                                     ex - let x = 5;
                                          x++;
                                          --x;

* Assignment Operator: The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. Compound assignment operators 
                       (like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=) combine arithmetic operations with assignment.

                       ex - let x = 5;
                            x += 2

* Comparison Operators: These operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) compare two values and return a Boolean 
                        (true or false) based on the comparison result.

                        ex - let x = 5;
                             let y = 7;
                             console.log(x == y)

* Logical Operators: Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to combine conditional statements and return true or false. && (AND) 
                     returns true if both operands are true. || (OR) returns true if at least one operand is true. ! (NOT) returns 
                     the opposite Boolean value of the operand.

                     ex - let x = [7 , 2 , 5, 4]
                          console.log( 7 > 2 && 5 > 4)

* Unary Operators: These operate on a single operand to perform various actions. Examples include unary plus (+) and unary 
                   negation (-), which convert values to numbers and change their signs, respectively
