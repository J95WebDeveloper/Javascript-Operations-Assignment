Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary and ternary operators in javascript. Give examples
    of each.

Answer - 

Difference between - 

Unary Operator - Unary Operator is an operator that operates on a single operand, meaning it affects only one value or variable. 
                 Unary operators are commonly used in programming languages to perform various operations such as changing the 
                 sign of a value, incrementing or decrementing a value, or performing logical negation.
                 ex:
                    Unary minus (-x)
                    Increment (++)
                    Decrement (–)
                    Logical NOT (!x)

Binary Operator - Binary Operator is an operator that operates on two operands, meaning it affects two values or variables. 
                  Binary operators are commonly used in programming languages to perform various operations such as arithmetic 
                  operations, logical operations, and bitwise operations.
                  ex:
                    Addition (+)
                    Subtraction (-)
                    Multiplication (*)
                    Division (/)
                    Assignment (=)
                    Logical AND (&&)
                    Logical OR (||)

Ternary Operator - These operators require three operands. In JavaScript, there is one operator that falls under this category – 
                   the conditional operator. In other languages, perhaps, there could be more examples.
                   ex -
                    the conditional expression
                    the truthy expression which gets evaluated if the condition is true
                    the falsy expression which gets evaluated if the condition is false.
