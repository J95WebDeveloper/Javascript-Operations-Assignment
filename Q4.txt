Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in javascript. why is understanding these concepts important?

Answer - 

Precedence Operator -  Operator precedence determines the order in which different operators are evaluated in a complex expression. 
                       Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. This is similar to 
                       the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) in arithmetic.
                       ex -
                           let result = 3 + (4 * 2);
                           let result = 3 + 8;
                           let result = 11;

Associativity Operator - Operator associativity defines the direction in which operators of the same precedence level are processed. 
                         There are two types of associativity:
                         Left-to-right (Left Associativity): Operators are evaluated from left to right.
                         Right-to-left (Right Associativity): Operators are evaluated from right to left.
                         ex - 
                         let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
                             a = b = c;
